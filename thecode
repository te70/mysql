Open `C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini` (MySQL config file)

Find the line `[mysqld]` and right below it add `skip-grant-tables`. Example:

```
# The MySQL server
[mysqld]
skip-grant-tables
port= 3306
socket = "C:/xampp/mysql/mysql.sock"
basedir = "C:/xampp/mysql" 
tmpdir = "C:/xampp/tmp" 
[...etc...]
```

This should allow you to access MySQL if you don't know your password.

Stop and start MySQL from XAMPP to make this change take effect.

Next, in command line, connect to MySQL:

```
C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql.exe --user=root
```

Once in MySQL command line "select" the `mysql` database:

```
USE mysql;
```

Then, the following command will list all your MySQL users:
```
SELECT * FROM user \G;
```

You can scan through the rows to see what the `root` user's password is set to. There will be a few `root` users listed, with different hosts.

To set all `root` user's to have a blank password, run this command:

```
UPDATE user SET password = '' WHERE user = 'root';
```

When you're done, run `exit;` to exit the MySQL command line.

Next, re-enable password checking by removing `skip-grant-tables` from `C:\xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini`. 

Save changes, restart MySQL from XAMPP.

## Test it
Finally, test you can connect to the database using username `root` and password `''` (blank) via one of the following methods:

1. Attempting to access phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
2. Run the [debug route](https://github.com/susanBuck/dwa15-fall2017/blob/master/03_Laravel/24_Local_database_config.md#test-your-connection) I provided from within one of your Laravel apps
